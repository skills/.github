_Learn how to use GitHub with interactive courses designed for beginners and experts._

- **Learning should be fun**: There are no simulations or boring tutorials here, just hands-on lessons created by GitHub and taught inside Issues using GitHub Actions.
- **Real projects**: Learn new skills while working in your own copy of a real project.
- **Helpful guidance**: Your favorite Octocat provides instructions and feedback throughout your journey.
- **Real workflow**: Everything happens with real GitHub features, such as Issues, Actions, and Codespaces.
